# Service application initiated chat conversations

When a service application starts a chat conversation, it sends requests to its Trusted Application (UCAP) endpoint to discover and use the capabilities in the UCAP APIs. Messaging capabilities must be supported in the application endpoint to enable chat conversations.
  
## Configure a service application for chat
A service application must be configured in Azure to request instant messaging permissions before it can call UCAP messaging APIs. The following actions are taken to configure a service application:

- Open the [Azure Active Directory (AAD) management portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com) and choose the Active Directory node from the tool bar on the left side of the window.
- Choose the directory that contains the service application that you are configuring.
- Choose the applications tab and then choose the application you are configuring. 
- Select the **Send/Receive Instant Messages (preview)** Application Permission. 

   >Note: This process is covered in greater detail in [Registering your application in Azure AD](./RegistrationInAzureActiveDirectory.md)

- Get tenant administrator consent to grant the service application permission request.  See [Tenant Admin Consent.](./TenantAdminConsent.md)

The Service Application now can send requests to the UCAP APIs to use the "Send/Receive Instant Messages (preview)" capability for that tenant.
 
## Service application initiated chat Callflow example
Let us go through this call flow with a simple example:
 
The Service Application uses the UCAP APIs to send an instant message to a user in SFB online. The user's sip uri is already known to the Service Application via some other means.

The details of this example are available in [Messaging Call Flow](./MessagingCallFlow.md).
